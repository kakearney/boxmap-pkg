# boxworldmap.m (and friends)

This project holds a collection of Matlab functions designed to create squared-up versions of non-rectangular map axes in Matlab.  These are all something of a work in progress.  At the moment, the boxworldmap.m function is the most robust (and least heavy-handed) of the options.
